# ALBundeCrypt

Code from Azur Lane for decoding/decrypting asset bundles, adapted to be more readable for humans.
We are currently working on an encoding method.

# Usage 
To use ALBundeCrypt, enter the following command in your terminal:

`ALBundeCrypt "input" ["output"]`

Where "input" is the path to the input asset bundle file, and "output" is the path to the output file where the decoded asset bundle will be saved.
